How doth the little crocodile
improve his shiny tail,
and pours the waters of the Nile
on every golden scale.
How cheerfully he seems to grin,
how neatly spreads his claws,
and welcomes little fishes in
with gently smiling jaws!


Will you walk a little faster
said the whithing to a snail
there's a porpoise close behind us
and he's treading on my tail
see how eagerly the turtles
and the lobsters all advance
they're waiting on the shingly
wont you come and join the dance?



Lewis Carroll
