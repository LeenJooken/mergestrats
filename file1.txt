Twas brillig and the slighty toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe
all mimsy were the borogoves and the momeraths outgrabe

beware the jabberwock my son!
jaws that bite claws that catch
beware the jubjub bird and shun
the frumious bandersnatch

He took his vorpal sword in hand
long time the maxoeme foe he sought
so rested he by the tumtum tree
and stood a while in thought

And as in uffish thought he stood
the Jabberwock with eyes of flame
came whiffling through the Tulgey wood
and burbled as it came

one two, one two and through and through
the Vorpal blade went snicker-snack
he left it dead and with his head
he went galumping back

and has thou slain the Jabberwock
come to my arms my beamish boy!
Oh frabjous day callooh callay
he chortled in his joy

Twas brillig
and the slighty toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe
all mimsy were the borogoves
and the momeraths outgrabe
